# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🧠 Project Overview
The **Heart Prediction System** uses physiological signals (such as heart rate, SpO₂, and ECG data) to predict potential cardiac anomalies or risks in real time.  
Given the sensitive nature of health data, security, privacy, and responsible handling are our top priorities.
